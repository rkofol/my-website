                <h2> Claude Monet</h2>
                <p>Claude Monet, a central figure in the Impressionist movement, was born in Paris in 1840. He is
                    renowned
                    for
                    his exceptional ability to capture the essence of light and atmosphere in his paintings. Monet's
                    early
                    works
                    depicted scenes of everyday life, but he later focused on landscapes and outdoor settings, often
                    painting
                    the same subject multiple times to capture the changing light and weather conditions. His most
                    famous
                    series
                    include the water lilies in his garden at Giverny, the haystacks, and the Rouen Cathedral. Monet's
                    innovative use of color, brushwork, and composition revolutionized the art world and laid the
                    foundation
                    for
                    modern art. He continued to paint until his death in 1926, leaving behind a legacy of beauty and
                    inspiration
                    that continues to captivate audiences worldwide.</p>

            <img src="../images/renoir.jpg" alt="Image of Pierre-Auguste Renoir">
            <div class="artist-desc">
                <h2>Pierre-Auguste Renoir</h2>
                <p> Pierre-Auguste Renoir, another prominent figure in the Impressionist movement, was born in
                    Limoges, France,
                    in 1841. Known for his mastery of depicting light, color, and the human form, Renoir's works often
                    portrayed
                    scenes of leisure, particularly in outdoor settings. His paintings exude warmth, joy, and a sense of
                    vitality, capturing moments of everyday life with a soft, luminous touch. Renoir's style evolved
                    over
                    his
                    career, from the more formal compositions of his early years to the loose, spontaneous brushwork of
                    his
                    later Impressionist period. He was particularly skilled in portraying the beauty of women, often
                    featuring
                    them in his works as muses or subjects of admiration. Despite facing criticism and financial
                    struggles
                    during his lifetime, Renoir persevered and eventually gained widespread acclaim for his
                    contributions to
                    the
                    art world. Today, his paintings are celebrated for their timeless charm and enduring appeal.</p>

                <h2>Edgar Degas</h2>
                <p>Edgar Degas, born in Paris in 1834, was a key figure in the Impressionist movement, although he
                    preferred
                    to
                    be called a realist or independent. Renowned for his depictions of dancers, Degas captured the
                    grace,
                    movement, and emotion of the ballet world with unparalleled skill. His works often showcased
                    behind-the-scenes glimpses of rehearsals and backstage moments, offering a unique perspective on the
                    dance
                    culture of his time. Degas was a master of composition and often experimented with unconventional
                    viewpoints
                    and cropping techniques. Beyond his fascination with dance, he also explored other subjects such as
                    horse
                    racing, women in domestic settings, and the everyday life of Parisians. Despite experiencing vision
                    problems
                    later in life, Degas continued to create art until his death in 1917, leaving behind a legacy of
                    innovation
                    and influence in the art world.</p>
