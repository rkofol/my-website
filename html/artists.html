            <h2> Claude Monet</h2>
            <p>Claude Monet, a central figure in the Impressionist movement, was born in Paris in 1840. He is renowned
                for
                his exceptional ability to capture the essence of light and atmosphere in his paintings. Monet's early
                works
                depicted scenes of everyday life, but he later focused on landscapes and outdoor settings, often
                painting
                the same subject multiple times to capture the changing light and weather conditions. His most famous
                series
                include the water lilies in his garden at Giverny, the haystacks, and the Rouen Cathedral. Monet's
                innovative use of color, brushwork, and composition revolutionized the art world and laid the foundation
                for
                modern art. He continued to paint until his death in 1926, leaving behind a legacy of beauty and
                inspiration
                that continues to captivate audiences worldwide.</p>

            <h2>Pierre-Auguste Renoir</h2>
            <p> Pierre-Auguste Renoir, another prominent figure in the Impressionist movement, was born in
                Limoges, France,
                in 1841. Known for his mastery of depicting light, color, and the human form, Renoir's works often
                portrayed
                scenes of leisure, particularly in outdoor settings. His paintings exude warmth, joy, and a sense of
                vitality, capturing moments of everyday life with a soft, luminous touch. Renoir's style evolved over
                his
                career, from the more formal compositions of his early years to the loose, spontaneous brushwork of his
                later Impressionist period. He was particularly skilled in portraying the beauty of women, often
                featuring
                them in his works as muses or subjects of admiration. Despite facing criticism and financial struggles
                during his lifetime, Renoir persevered and eventually gained widespread acclaim for his contributions to
                the
                art world. Today, his paintings are celebrated for their timeless charm and enduring appeal.</p>

            <h2>Edgar Degas</h2>
            <p>Edgar Degas, born in Paris in 1834, was a key figure in the Impressionist movement, although he preferred
                to
                be called a realist or independent. Renowned for his depictions of dancers, Degas captured the grace,
                movement, and emotion of the ballet world with unparalleled skill. His works often showcased
                behind-the-scenes glimpses of rehearsals and backstage moments, offering a unique perspective on the
                dance
                culture of his time. Degas was a master of composition and often experimented with unconventional
                viewpoints
                and cropping techniques. Beyond his fascination with dance, he also explored other subjects such as
                horse
                racing, women in domestic settings, and the everyday life of Parisians. Despite experiencing vision
                problems
                later in life, Degas continued to create art until his death in 1917, leaving behind a legacy of
                innovation
                and influence in the art world.</p>
